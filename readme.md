This is a collection of scripts for Stone Story RPG. You can start using some of them as soon as you unlock the Mind Stone, but some will require the Moondial as well.

There are three ways you can use these scripts:

1: On PC, you can download the repository and place the scripts into your game's Stonescript folder, then import the ones you want using StoneScript's import command.

2: On mobile, you can import them directly from the Github. This is a bit more complicated, so you may need to seek help on how to do this.

3: On PC or mobile, you can paste scripts directly into the Mind Stone. You can do so as many times as you want, but keep in mind, too many scripts can become difficult to manage.
