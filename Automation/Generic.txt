/* This is a generic automation script, designed to be usable in any location without being optimized for any of them. It included rules that are needed in more than one location, and a basic set of equipment controls that will keep you alive in easy levels. To use this script, import or paste it above any automation scripts that are level-dependent. You can also copy and paste specific sections, if you only want certain effects. */
